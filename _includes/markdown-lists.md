### Task List
A task list is a list with checkboxes instead of bullets. If you include a task list in the body of an issue or pull request, you'll see a progress indicator in your issue list. The syntax for a task list is very specific: hyphen-space-square bracket-space-square bracket `- [ ]`

- [x] Create a task list
- [ ] Complete the tasks
  - This is nested with two spaces
- [ ] Check off items as they are completed
